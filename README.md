✏️ DrawBot — Precision Drawing with Polar Motion
Welcome to the repository of DrawBot, a custom-built polar-coordinate drawing robot designed to automate precision writing, pattern generation, and educational demonstrations.
This project blends mechanical design, kinematic synthesis, and computer vision to explore robotics and automation in a compact form.

🚀 Project Overview
DrawBot is an innovative solution for automated drawing and writing tasks that:

📸 Converts input images into contour points using MATLAB

📐 Computes inverse kinematics in polar coordinates (r, θ)

⚙️ Drives a unique 4-bar gear-coupled linkage for smooth polar motion

🖊️ Accurately controls pen position for precise line tracing

It’s ideal as an assistive writing device, educational tool, and for applications like PCB mask drawing or space-constrained robotics.

🧠 Key Features
✅ Custom Kinematics: Unique geared 4-bar linkage design for radial and angular control
✅ Polar Coordinate Control: Precise positioning with independent radius (r) and angle (θ) motion
✅ Image to Path Conversion: MATLAB-based contour extraction and path planning
✅ Original Design: Entire CAD model, linkage synthesis, and kinematics developed from scratch
